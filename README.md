In the following study, a Robo Advisory system has been developed behind an interface for picking
mutual funds in terms of investment. Different types of investors have been identified along with
classification of mutual funds. Sharpe ratio, Treynor ratio, Jenson ratio and Modified Sharpe ratios
have been used to check the performance and ranking of the mutual funds. Black litter-man model
theory has been implemented in this regard in order to explain various concepts; it is the modified
form of Markovitz theory. In this manner, this particular study only focused mutual funds in
Pakistan and a web-based solution has been utilized to guide the investors by providing optimal
weights of funds. This research can help the investors to allocate their investment in mutual funds
to maximize their returns with certain level of risk. At the same time, few recommendations are
also provided for future researches.
